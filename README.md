Requirements:

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
Â 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g., a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Assumptions:
1. Transactions can contain more than 3 months of past data. So necessary filtering of transaction data
for 3 months is done.
2. Exactly 3 months are considered. Not the 90 days data from current date.
3. Simulation can be done using mock api tool. Have used https://mockapi.io/clone/63b793e34d97e82aa3c070b7 with a suitable schema for the given requirement. Data is framed to cover assumption 1.

How to use or test this app?
NOTE: Have stable internet connection since it has over the internet API calls.
1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Run npm install.
3. Run npm start to run the application
4. Run npm run test to run test cases.

Customer Rewards App:
1. Has a home page (http://localhost:3000/) which by default loads all the transactions from the api.
2. Navigate to "Rewards" page (http://localhost:3000/rewards): Lists all the customers and their monthly points (current month) and total points for the recent 3 months. Can filter the data using "month" dropdown.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
